 	<h1>Dogs are Better Than Cats</h1>
 	<p>No argument needed. But one will be provided for reasons. </p>
 	<p>Dogs are so obviously better than cats. Why? Here is a list of reasons: </p>

 	<ol> 
 		<li>Dogs actually love their owners</li>
 		<p>Cats don't love anyone because their souls belong to THE DEVIL. They are parasites and LEECH the love from their owners. Dogs just hand you their love because they're kind and have souls. </p>
 		<li>Dogs can swim</li>
 		<P>You know how the witch in The Wizard of Oz melted when they put water on it? Enough said.</P>
 		<li>Dogs will play with you</li>
 		<P>Cats don't play. They don't know how to play. They only play with your mind. They also scratch you and call it "playing". </P>
 		<li>Dogs wait for you to come home</li>
 		<p>In all my years of never owning a cat, not once has it waited at the door for me to come home.</p>
 		<li>Cats have no energy</li>
 		<P>All they do is sleep all day. Lame.</P>
 		<P>You can get different kinds of dogs</P>
 		<P>There are so many different kinds of dogs. There are small, medium and big dogs and they all look different! There are only two kinds of cats. Demon with hair, demon with no hair.</P>
 		<p>...and finally...</p>
 		<li>I've never had a good expirience with cats</li>
 		<p>I have NEVER had a good expirience with cats. That must mean that they're terrible. I'm also allergic and feel uncomfortable around them. Must be witch craft.</p>
 	</ol>
