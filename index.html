	<title> Cats Are Better Than Dogs</title>
	<body>
		<h4>There are many reasons why cats are better than dogs. To start, they're not as expensive. Not just the cat itself, but the supplies for cats as well. They aren't as needy. You can leave for a weekend and as long as they have a big bowl of food and water they'll be fine. Unlike dogs who need to be let outside multiple times a day, cats are fine with just a litter box. They also clean themselves and stink way less.</h4>
